## My process

* style the remaining HTML - Lots of CTRL+S and F5!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Just learning how to use Figma. This project was a nice intro to that!

### Continued development

Always looking for best practices especially in regards to accessibility and responsivity. Any feedback received may be added here at a later date.
